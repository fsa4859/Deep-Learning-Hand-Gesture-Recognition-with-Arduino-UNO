# Deep-Learning-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-with-Arduino-UNO
Project implementing hand gesture deep learning model with Arduino UNO.
## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning hand gesture recognition on Arduino UNO. The model is trained on Teachable Machine Learning from Google and is being transferred to Arduino via Bluetooth and Serial Communication.
## Training model on Teachable Machine Learning
Project's Objectives
1. Integrate the power of deep learning with low cost microcontroller Arduino UNO.
2. Develop a sensory based system to construct obstacle avoidance robot. 
3. Develop solid understanding of serial and bluetooth communication between Arduino UNO and P5 Java Script files.
