# Deep-Learning-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-with-Arduino-UNO
Project implementing hand gesture deep learning model with Arduino UNO.
## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning hand gesture recognition on Arduino UNO. The model is trained on Teachable Machine Learning from Google and is being transferred to Arduino via Bluetooth and Serial Communication.
